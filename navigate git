commmit and push to git 


in root dir 
echo "# test" >> README.md

git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/PranavKamlaskar/test.git
git push -u origin main



if some problem occurs 
Revoke the leaked token (security)

Remove secrets from files & ignore them (future safety)

Rewrite git history to remove the secret (so GitHub stops blocking)

Force-push the cleaned history






1Revoke the leaked token (security)
2️⃣ Remove secrets from your working tree & ignore those files- delete the files or the line 
3️⃣ Rewrite Git history to remove the secret (the crucial part)
From your repo root:
pip install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --path .env --path scripts/.gha_log_fetch.swp --invert-paths

Rewrites your repo history

Completely removes .env and scripts/.gha_log_fetch.swp from every commit

git status   # to see what changed
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Remove secrets and ignore .env & swap files"


if 

our error tells us your repo no longer has a remote named origin.

This usually happens after:

rewriting history (like using git filter-repo), or

cloning without adding the remote, or

accidentally removing the remote.

Let's fix it cleanly.



git remote -v
You will likely see no output or something incorrect.

Re-add the GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/PranavKamlaskar/optimizer-mlops.git


git remote -v

git push -u origin main --force
